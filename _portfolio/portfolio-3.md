  <h3>1. World Model Software Development & Real-Time Performance</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Led the development and optimization of the <strong>World Model</strong>, ensuring it operates in real time during client testing.</li>
    <li>Integrated <strong>multi-sensor data (LiDAR, cameras, and GPS)</strong> into a centralized perception framework.</li>
    <li>Ensured <strong>low-latency processing</strong> and <strong>high reliability</strong> for vehicle perception and tracking.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div style="border: 1px solid #000; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
  <h3>2. Perception Algorithms for Object Detection & Localization</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Developed <strong>object detection and tracking</strong> algorithms using <strong>LiDAR and camera fusion</strong>.</li>
    <li>Implemented methods to calculate <strong>latitude and longitude</strong> of detected objects with high precision.</li>
    <li>Used <strong>PCL (Point Cloud Library) and OpenCV</strong> for point cloud and image processing.</li>
    <li>Computed <strong>intrinsic and extrinsic parameters</strong> for sensor alignment using <strong>OpenCV and Eigen</strong>, synchronized camera images and LiDAR point clouds, applied <strong>undistortion</strong> and <strong>point cloud filtering (PCL)</strong>, projected <strong>LiDAR points onto the image plane</strong>, optimized <strong>calibration accuracy</strong>, validated results using <strong>feature-based methods</strong>, and integrated calibrated data into <strong>ADAS and autonomous perception pipelines</strong> for real-world applications.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4. Client Testing & Real-World Deployment</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Took the lead in <strong>managing and troubleshooting the World Model</strong> software during client tests.</li>
    <li>Conducted <strong>post-test debriefings with clients</strong> (Renault, Stellantis, Valeo) to analyze and improve system performance.</li>
    <li>Provided <strong>support to the 5G team</strong> to ensure smooth operation of perception modules in real-world scenarios.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div style="border: 1px solid #000; padding: 10px;">
  <h3>5. Training & Team Collaboration</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Organized a <strong>ROS training session</strong> for the 5G Open Road team to enhance collaboration and improve the team's software development efficiency.</li>
  </ul>
