  Improving sorting and segregation of waste using machine learning, specifically with the YOLOv5 model, involves training the model to detect and classify different types of waste (e.g., plastic, metal, paper, organic, etc.) in images or video feeds. The YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once) model is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection algorithm that can accurately identify multiple objects in an image. In the context of waste management, YOLOv5 is used to recognize and categorize waste materials automatically, helping in the efficient sorting of recyclable and non-recyclable items. By deploying such a system, waste processing facilities can enhance automation, reduce human error, and improve recycling rates, leading to better waste management practices.
