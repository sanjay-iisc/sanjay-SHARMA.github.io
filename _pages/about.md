I am working on allowing computers to see and help us in our highly Bayesian probabilistic world. To do this, I have continuously developed skills in various areas like computer vision, machine and deep learning, signal processing for time series, uncertainty analysis, advanced statistics, simulation, and physics-based models. I am interested in using these skills in automotive, energy, and medical applications on the embedded and cloud platforms.

Current work
------
As a Research Engineer in Computer Vision at Capgemini Engineering, where I have been for over 1.5 years. ![LIDAr](images/Lidar.png){: .align-right width="300px"} Here, I developed a reliable perception module for cameras and LiDAR in Robot Operating System, developed in a mixed C++/Python environment, showcasing my ability to build robust detection systems using advanced machine learning techniques and implemented in both Nano Jetson and cloud.

Extra work
------
There was a four-month interval between the completion of my PhD and my commencement at Capgemini. During this time, I was engaged with a postdoctoral researcher at CEA-List in the **development of federated learning techniques, backdoor attacks and defense mechanisms using Robust Learning Rate (RLR)**. This work was applied to four datasets: German Traffic Sign, Fashion MNIST, EMNIST, and MNIST. 

PhD work
------
I hold a Ph.D. in **Image and Signal Processing** from [CEA-LIST](https://list.cea.fr/fr/), [Universit√© Paris-Saclay](https://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu-sn&channel=fs&q=universit%C3%A9+paris+saclay), completed in October 2022. My [Ph.D. research](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04318941) ![SHM](images/SHM.png){: .align-right width="500px"} focused on structural health monitoring, drawing parallels with human health monitoring. I used machine learning and statistical methods to improve defect detection in structures like airplanes and bridges.

My primary focus was on developing a **probability of detection (POD) curve**, which is a statistical method used to identify the minimum size of a defect that can be missed by an inspection algorithm while taking into account constraints on the limited availability of samples from the inspection structure. I achieved this by utilizing Bayesian probabilistic models to effectively evaluate and quantify performance differences across various use cases in terms of the POD curve. Additionally, I successfully conducted an experimental campaign involving thirteen aluminum plates to gather sufficient samples, along with a simulation study with uncertainty propagation, in order to provide a comprehensive convergence study and **decision making of "YES" or "NO" of presence of defect in the structure**. Furthermore, I implemented machine and deep learning models to predict performance based on experimental data, using classification and regression analysis on images reconstructed through imaging algorithms based on first principles. This work has contributed significantly to the advancement of guided wave SHM, and the corresponding paper is currently under writing.


<!-- Currently, on weekends, we are actively collaborating on backdoor attack and defense strategies for the YOLO model, as well as working on a research paper. Please note that this experience is not included in my resume. -->



At Capgemini, I have been part of the 5G Open Road consortium, working on a project to improve pedestrian safety with smart infrastructure. As the lead developer, I handle detection and tracking using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Kalman filters, ensuring real-time alerts for drivers via 5G. Additionally, I work on LiDAR detection/tracking, sensor fusion, and developing depth estimation algorithms for the Jetson Nano embedded system.




A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
